== Description ==

[WPBooster](http://wpbooster.net/) CDN will make your WordPress sites load faster and perform Better!

= Very easy to setup, just enable the plugin and enter your API key =

You don’t need to change DNS or server migration.
You will be able to use a high-speed CDN just to install the dedicated plugin to your WordPress and simply enter your API key.

= Very fast in a mobile environment =

Smartphones are currently spreading rapidly, but the line used for them are not very fast.
On the other hand, the content is bloated due to spread (such as Retina display) ultra-high resolution display typified by iPad and iPhone.
On 3G connection, the faster technology of WP Booster CDN reduces the time required to download the content to 1 / 3-1 / 2.

= Low cost! =

First time users get free 100 points upon sign up. 
100 points is equivalent to 2.25 GB. If you have consumed this, then you have to purchase prepaid points that we call "Megumi Points".
The payment for this service is by prepaid points system, so you will not be charged indefinitely.
Even when you have a sudden increase access, you won’t be charged more than what you've already paid for. 
Also, if your site is a general blog site (assuming a PV / 2 ~ 3 million/month), it will only cost a few dollars per month.
